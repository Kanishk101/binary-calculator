# Binary Calculator with GUI

## Overview
This project is a **Logic Gate Simulator for Arithmetic Operations** implemented using Python's `tkinter` library. The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface to perform binary addition, subtraction, and multiplication using fundamental logic gates.

## Features
- Perform **Binary Addition**, **Subtraction**, and **Multiplication**.
- Step-by-step breakdown of each calculation.
- Graphical representation of Full Adder, Full Subtractor, and Multiplier Circuits.
- Error handling for invalid binary inputs.

## How It Works
The program simulates basic binary arithmetic using logic gate functions:
- `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, and `NOT` gates for bitwise operations.
- **Full Adder** and **Full Subtractor** circuits for addition and subtraction.
- **Shift-and-Add Multiplier** for binary multiplication.

The GUI allows users to:
1. Enter two binary numbers.
2. Select an arithmetic operation.
3. View the computed result along with step-by-step explanations.
4. Visualize the corresponding logic circuit.

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
